The first server in the DNS chain is known as the DNS recursor and is responsible for interacting with the DNS infrastructure and returning the results to the client
The DNS recursor contacts one of the servers in the DNS root zone.
The DNS root server then respons with the address of the server responsible for the zone containing the Top Level Domain(TLD)

Once the DNS recursor receives the address of the TLD DNS server, it queries it for the address of the authoritative nameserver for the domain.
The authoritative nameserver is the final step in the DNS lookup process and contains the DNS records in a local database known as the zone file.
It typically hosts two zones for each domain, the forward lookup zone that is used to find the IP address of a specific hostname
and the reverse lookup zone(if configured), which is used to find the hostname of a specific IP address.
Once the DNS recursor provides the DNS client with the IP address for the domain, the browser can contact the correct webserver at its IP address and load the webpage.

NS - Nameserver records contain the name of the authoritative servers hosting the records for a domain
A - Also know as a host record, the "a record" conaints the ip address of a hostname(such as megacorpone.com)
MX - Mail Exchange records. Contains the names of the servers responsible for handling email
PTR - Pointer Records are used in reverse lookup zones and are used to find the records associated with an IP address
CNAME - Canonical name record are usd to create aliases for other host records
TXT - Text records can contain any arbitarydata and can be used for various purposes
