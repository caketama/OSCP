Port scanning is the process of inspecting TCP or UDP ports on a remote machine with the intention of detecting what services are running on the target and what potential attack vectors may exist.

Nmaps needs raw sockets to work best, always use sudo

Nmap's preferred scanning technique  is a SYN, or "stealth" scan.

SYN scanning is a tcp port scanning method that involves sending SYN packets to various ports on a target machine without completing a TCP handshake.
If a TCP is open, a SYN-ACK should be sent back from the target machine, informing us that the port is open. At this point, the port scanner does not bother to send the final ACK to complete the three-way handshake.

nmap -sS for syn scan
nmap -sU for udp scanning
